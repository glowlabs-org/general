# Glow Bot

This code was nearly entirely written by GPT 4.

The Glow Bot is a discord bot that collects messages from discord channels so
that they can be used as training data in the Glow LLM. Eventually, users will
be able to ask the Glow LLM questions via GlowBot, and GlowBot will give the
answer provided by the LLM.
